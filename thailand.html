                     <p>Tightening her calf muscles, <br>
                        She steps on the pestle ... <br>
                        Tup ... Tup <br><br>
                        
                        Lifting and releasing, repeatedly <br>
                        The husk is pounded, <br>
                        By firm legs that move <br>
                        To the rhythm of the pestle, <br><br>
                        
                        TukTak Tup .. . <br>
                        TukTakTup .. . <br><br>
                        
                        Her skillful legs, <br>
                        Neither white or tender <br>
                        Tip up the edge of her lower garment, <br>
                        Her movement is strong and skillful. <br>
                        She lifts her foot to press down the pole, <br>
                        Press and release, <br>
                        Press and release, <br>
                        The sound of pole striking the husk. .. <br><br>
                        
                        Tuk Tuk Tup! Tuk Tuk Tup! <br><br>
                        
                        Faster and faster she pounds <br>
                        Again and again she wipes away <br>
                        the glittering sweat, <br>
                        But her smile remains <br>
                        The smile that chokes my heart <br>
                        Many young women stand shoulder to <br>
                        Shoulder <br><br>
                        
                        Stepping and releasing again and again <br>
                        The sound of the pestle mixed with <br>
                        laughter And teasing<br>
                        When the husk is cracked <br>
                        Two small hands scoop <br>
                        The shining white rice from the mortar <br>
                        Carefully pour it into the winnowing tray <br><br>
                        
                        Taralaek! Taralaek! <br><br>
                        
                        The grain spins and bounces <br>
                        To and fro <br>
                        Nearly missing the tray.<br>
                         Left and right it sways, <br>
                        With a rice-dance, hypnotic motion. <br><br>
                        
                        Beauty and strength mingle <br>
                        In that winnowing tray <br>
                        With sweat that pours freely. <br><br>
                        
                        When no one forces it <br>
                        It pours energy <br>
                        That spreads a stream of the spirit <br>
                        Of selflessness <br><br>
                        
                        There are no traces of tears in the sweat<br>
                         With this rice ... the people repay their<br>
                         warriors <br>
                        The goddess of rice, carrying her baskets, <br>
                        approaches <br>
                        With the hint of a smile <br>
                        Wipes the sweat from her brow. <br>
